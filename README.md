What is Tic Tac Toe?
Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player strategy game played on a 3×3 grid. Players take turns marking empty spaces with either an "X" or an "O". The goal of the game is to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal before the opponent does. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw (tie).
